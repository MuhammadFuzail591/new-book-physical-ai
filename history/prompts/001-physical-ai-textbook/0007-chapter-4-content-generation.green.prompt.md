## Prompt

Create the missing files for Chapter 4 in the Physical AI textbook: 01-nodes-implementation.mdx, 02-topics-communication.mdx, 03-services-actions.mdx, and 04-chapter-summary.mdx in the ros2-communication directory, and update tasks.md to mark Chapter 4 tasks as completed.

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive content for all Chapter 4 files (01-nodes-implementation.mdx, 02-topics-communication.mdx, 03-services-actions.mdx, 04-chapter-summary.mdx) based on the existing content in the ros2-communication directory, and updated the tasks in tasks.md to reflect completion.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Completed implementation of Chapter 4 content for the Physical AI textbook, including detailed sections on nodes implementation, topics communication, services and actions in ROS 2
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created 4 content files and updated tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Structured content generation based on existing comprehensive content ensured consistency across all chapter files
