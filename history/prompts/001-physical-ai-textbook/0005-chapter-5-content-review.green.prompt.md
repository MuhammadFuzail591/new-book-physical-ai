## Prompt

Hey go and check chapter 5 in docs/physical-ai and generate content for all the files inside

## Response snapshot

Chapter 5 (Building ROS 2 Packages, Launch Files & Parameters) in the Physical AI textbook is already complete with comprehensive content across all files. The chapter includes:

- index.mdx: Main chapter introduction covering package structure, learning outcomes, and comprehensive examples
- building-packages.mdx: Detailed guide on creating C++/Python packages, dependencies, build configuration, testing and quality assurance
- launch-files.mdx: Complete coverage of Python and XML launch files, multi-robot systems, composable nodes, and best practices
- parameters.mdx: Thorough documentation of the ROS 2 parameter system, types, validation, configuration files, and dynamic reconfiguration
- chapter-summary.mdx: Summary of key concepts, implementation patterns, and practical applications

All content follows Docusaurus MDX format with proper headings, code examples, and explanations appropriate for Physical AI and humanoid robotics applications.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Verified that chapter 5 content is complete and comprehensive
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required as content already exists
- 📁 Files: All 5 chapter files reviewed and confirmed to have complete content
- 🔁 Next prompts: None required as chapter is complete
- 🧠 Reflection: Chapter 5 was already fully implemented with detailed content covering all required topics

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all files contained complete, well-structured content
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - chapter is complete as required
