## Prompt

Hey go and check chapter 6 in docs/physical-ai and generate content for all the files inside

## Response snapshot

Chapter 6 (URDF/SDF for Humanoid Robots) in the Physical AI textbook is already complete with comprehensive content across all files. The chapter includes:

- index.mdx: Main chapter introduction covering URDF/SDF fundamentals, kinematic chain design for humanoid robots, and advanced Xacro macros
- urdf-basics.mdx: Detailed guide on URDF structure, links, joints, inertial properties, and best practices
- sdf-for-simulation.mdx: Complete coverage of SDF for simulation, advanced physics properties, sensor integration, and world description
- chapter-summary.mdx: Summary of key concepts, implementation patterns, and practical applications

All content follows Docusaurus MDX format with proper headings, XML code examples, and explanations appropriate for Physical AI and humanoid robotics applications.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Verified that chapter 6 content is complete and comprehensive
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required as content already exists
- 📁 Files: All 4 chapter files reviewed and confirmed to have complete content
- 🔁 Next prompts: None required as chapter is complete
- 🧠 Reflection: Chapter 6 was already fully implemented with detailed content covering all required topics

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all files contained complete, well-structured content
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - chapter is complete as required
