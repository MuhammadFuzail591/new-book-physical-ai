## Prompt

Hey go and check chapter 7 in docs/physical-ai and generate content for all the files inside

## Response snapshot

Chapter 7 (Gazebo Simulation: Physics, Sensors & World Building) in the Physical AI textbook is already complete with comprehensive content across all files. The chapter includes:

- index.mdx: Main chapter introduction covering Gazebo fundamentals, physics engines, sensor simulation, and world building
- physics-engines.mdx: Detailed guide on ODE, Bullet, and Simbody physics engines with configuration examples
- world-building.mdx: Complete coverage of environment design, custom models, and simulation scenarios
- chapter-summary.mdx: Summary of key concepts, implementation patterns, and practical applications

All content follows Docusaurus MDX format with proper headings, XML code examples, and explanations appropriate for Physical AI and humanoid robotics applications.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Verified that chapter 7 content is complete and comprehensive
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required as content already exists
- 📁 Files: All 4 chapter files reviewed and confirmed to have complete content
- 🔁 Next prompts: None required as chapter is complete
- 🧠 Reflection: Chapter 7 was already fully implemented with detailed content covering all required topics

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all files contained complete, well-structured content
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - chapter is complete as required
