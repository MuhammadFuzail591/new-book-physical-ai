# Glossary of Terms

This glossary contains technical terminology used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## A

### Actuator
A component of a robot that converts control signals into physical motion.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

## B

### Behavior Tree
A hierarchical structure used to organize and control the execution of tasks in robotics.

## C

### Computer Vision
A field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world.

### Control Theory
An engineering and mathematics field dealing with the dynamic behavior of systems.

## D

### Deep Learning
A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

### Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
The number of independent movements a mechanical system can make.

## E

### Embodied Intelligence
Intelligence that emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment.

## F

### Forward Kinematics
The use of joint parameters to compute the Cartesian coordinates of the end effector.

## G

### Gazebo
A 3D simulation environment for robotics that provides physics simulation and sensor models.

## I

### Inverse Kinematics
The use of Cartesian coordinates to compute joint parameters.

## L

### LIDAR
Light Detection and Ranging - a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser.

## M

### Manipulator
A robotic device used to manipulate objects in the environment.

## N

### Neural Network
A computing system inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.

## P

### Physical AI
The field of artificial intelligence focused on embodied systems that interact with the physical world.

### Point Cloud
A collection of data points in a three-dimensional coordinate system.

## R

### Robot Operating System (ROS)
A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster.

### ROS 2
The second generation of the Robot Operating System with improved security, real-time support, and multi-robot systems.

## S

### Sensor Fusion
The combining of sensory data or data derived from disparate sources such that the resulting information has less uncertainty than would be possible when these sources were used individually.

### Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

## T

### Trajectory Planning
The process of creating a path that a robot will follow to reach a target position.

## V

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
A system that integrates visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical action.

## W

### Waypoint
A reference point for navigation that helps define a route or path.

## Y

### Yaw
The rotation of an aircraft or robot about its vertical axis.
